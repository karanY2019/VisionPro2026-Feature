implemented the WhiteMatte Cabinet Material Modification MVP following the implementation plan. Here's what was completed:

__Files Created/Modified:__

1. __CabinetMaterial.swift__ - New model file defining CabinetMaterial struct with WhiteMatte, woodGrain, darkWalnut, grayModern options
2. __AppModel.swift__ - Updated with cabinet material state management
3. __CabinetMaterialSelector.swift__ - New UI component with circular color previews and horizontal scrolling
4. __SecondImmersiveView.swift__ - Updated with cabinet entity detection, material update functions, and immersive view integration

__Key Implementation Features:__

- __No Downloads Required__: Uses existing kitchen cabinets in House.usdz via shader parameter modification only
- __Real-time Updates__: Searches for cabinet entities using keywords and modifies ShaderGraphMaterial parameters (cabinetColor, roughness, metallic)
- __User Interface__: Floating material selector in immersive view with glassmorphic design
- __Immediate Application__: Changes apply instantly to all cabinets in the house

__Technical Approach:__

- WhiteMatte achieved through RGB(0.95, 0.95, 0.95) color with high roughness (0.8) and zero metallic properties
- Uses NotificationCenter for real-time communication between UI and 3D view
- Fallback to UnlitMaterial for non-shader materials
- 15-minute implementation as planned

__Expected User Experience:__ Users can now enter the immersive view, see a floating cabinet material selector, tap different materials (WhiteMatte, WoodGrain, DarkWalnut, etc.), and instantly see cabinet colors/textures change in real-time.

This implementation provides immediate cabinet customization functionality with zero additional asset downloads and minimal development effort, exactly as specified in the WhiteMatte Cabinet Implementation plan.
